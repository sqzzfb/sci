parsers of clash_for_windows for institution researchers
I use the iKuuu vpn to use the google scholar, etc. However, some sci journals could only be available after IP verification, which means some specific url need a direct connection. 
So I create this parsers. The parsers could update the clash rules to visit most of the academic websites by direct connection.
